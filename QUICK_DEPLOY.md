# Quick Deploy to Vercel (No CLI Needed!)

## Easiest Method - Drag & Drop

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/new
2. **Sign up/Login** (use GitHub, Google, or email)
3. **Drag and drop** your entire project folder (`waiter` folder) onto the page
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for deployment
5. **Done!** Your site will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

## What to Drag & Drop

Make sure these files are in the folder:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ vercel.json
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ .gitignore

**That's it!** No configuration needed - Vercel will automatically detect it as a static site.

## After Deployment

1. Copy your deployment URL
2. Test it in your browser
3. Make sure to allow microphone access when prompted
4. Click "Start Call" to test!

**Note**: If you prefer CLI method, complete the `vercel login` process first, then I can deploy it for you automatically.
